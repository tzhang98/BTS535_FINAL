# Project Risks and Assumptions
## A. Project Risks
Technology Integration Challenges: Integrating the new system with existing restaurant operations and technology might pose compatibility issues.

Budget Overruns: Unforeseen costs in software development or hardware procurement could lead to budget overruns.

Delays in Development Schedule: Software development might face delays due to technical challenges or resource constraints.

Data Security Risks: Storing customer data and processing payments introduces risks related to data security and privacy.

Resistance to Change: Staff might resist adopting the new system, affecting the implementation process.

System Performance Issues: Post-launch, the system might face performance issues like slow response times or downtime, affecting user experience.

Regulatory Compliance: Failing to comply with data protection regulations (like GDPR) could result in legal issues.

Inadequate User Training: Ineffective training of staff and management could lead to improper use of the system.

## B. Project Assumptions
